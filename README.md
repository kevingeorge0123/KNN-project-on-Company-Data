Predict the target class using a give new of features.

Used standard scalers to normalize the data 

Build a model using KNeighborsClassifier and chossing a K value of higher accuracy in prediction by plotting error rate and k value

Validation on test set using confusion matrix and classification report with precision and recall for both target class above 0.92 and overall F1 score to be 0.95.
